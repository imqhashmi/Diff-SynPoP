# A differentiable approach for modelling multi-layer Synthetic Populations

### Summary
This codebase provides a differentiable approach for generating synthetic demographic data, employing a combination of neural networks, tensor operations, and data aggregation techniques.


The novelty of the script's approach, particularly in the context of differentiability, lies in its innovative use of the Gumbel-Softmax function and modular neural network architecture. Let's delve into how this contributes to the script's differentiability and the main benefits of this approach:

### Differentiable Approach:
1. **Gumbel-Softmax for Discrete Data Generation**: Typically, generating discrete data (like categorical demographic characteristics) is challenging in gradient-based optimization because the process is non-differentiable. The Gumbel-Softmax function is a clever solution to this issue. It approximates categorical distributions in a way that is continuous and differentiable, allowing standard backpropagation techniques to be used for training neural networks. This method bridges the gap between the need for discrete outputs and the requirement for differentiable operations in neural network training.

2. **Modular Neural Networks**: The script uses distinct neural networks for different demographic characteristics, each learning to model a specific aspect of the data. This modular architecture allows each network to focus on one demographic feature at a time, making the learning process more manageable and efficient. Additionally, the use of linear layers and ReLU activations in these networks ensures that the entire model is differentiable, allowing for effective gradient-based optimization.

### Main Benefits:
1. **Enables Gradient-Based Optimization**: The differentiability of the entire process allows the use of gradient descent and backpropagation, which are fundamental techniques in training deep neural networks. This leads to more efficient and effective learning.

2. **Facilitates Discrete Data Modeling**: By employing Gumbel-Softmax, the script can model discrete data categories (like age groups or ethnicities) while still leveraging the power of neural networks. This is particularly important in demographic studies where data is inherently categorical.

3. **Improves Model Accuracy and Flexibility**: Differentiable operations enable the networks to adjust their weights in a fine-grained manner, potentially leading to higher accuracy in the synthetic data generated. It also provides flexibility in model design and optimization, allowing for various architectures and loss functions to be employed effectively.

4. **Scalability and Adaptability**: The modular and differentiable nature of the architecture makes it easier to scale the model to accommodate more demographic categories or to adapt it to different datasets and requirements.
